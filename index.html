            <h2>Welcome to our desert city!</h2>                
            <p>
                Tucson is an innovative, sustainable community that is a model of desert-adaptive living and a hub for ecotourism - a gateway to the Sky Islands with their diverse habitats and wildlife. Tucson is renowned for our advances in rainwater harvesting - an example to other arid regions. Our annual rain nourishes lush native landscaping working in harmony with our unique desert surroundings.

                There is so much more to Tucson than just sun (though we have plenty!) We are well known for our outdoor activities, but Tucson also boasts a thriving art and food scene. Tucson was designated a City of Gastronomy -  not just because of our great Mexican food - but because Tucson has the longest continuous agriculture in North America with traditional low-water farming techniques and heritage seeds preserved to this day. Our local chefs are inspired by our diverse cultures, local sourcing and native desert foods.

                Here is everything you need to enjoy a sustainable desert-adapted lifestyle.
