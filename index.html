            <p>Tucson is an  innovative, sustainable community that is a model of desert-adaptive living and a hub for ecotourism - a gateway to the Sky Islands with their diverse habitats and wildlife.</p>
            <p>There is more to Tucson than just sun (though we have plenty!) We are well known for our outdoor activities, but Tucson also boasts a thriving art and food scene. Tucson was designated a City of Gastronomy -  not just because of our great Mexican food - but because Tucson has the longest continuous agriculture in North America. Our chefs are inspired by our diverse cultures, local sourcing and native desert foods.</p>
            <p>Here is everything you need to enjoy a sustainable desert-adapted lifestyle.</p>
